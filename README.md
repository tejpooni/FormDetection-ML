# FormDetection-ML
*This project uses ML technologies like OpenPose and CNNs to provide real-time feedback on exercise form for pushups, situps, and jumping jacks. By analyzing video, it helps ensure exercises are done safely and effectively, using a dataset of exercises for accurate feedback.

*I'm crafting a workout tool that transforms your exercise routine by ensuring you nail the perfect form in pushups, situps, and jumping jacks. Through real-time feedback from a video analysis, you'll get personalized tips to improve each move.

*Leveraging machine learning tech like OpenPose, neural networks, and posture analysis, this project aims to minimize injuries and boost the effectiveness of your workouts. By analyzing gestures and movements, it offers precise guidance for every exercise.

*The backbone of this system is a dataset from Kaggle, featuring 500 videos of exercises done right. With K-clustering to recognize and classify movements, and F1 scores to gauge accuracy, I'm setting up a feedback loop that adapts to your personal workout style.

*This isn't just about doing more reps; it's about making every rep count with the right technique. My goal? To bring a tool to the fitness community that enhances safety, efficiency, and results in your training routine.
